const DISCLAIMER = `The operator (the "Operator") of this website or mobile application has implemented, deployed, and is operating open source software (the "SDK") that overlays the Snowbridge protocol, a cross chain messaging protocol. THIS SDK AND THE SNOWBRIDGE PROTOCOL ARE MADE AVAILABLE "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. By using or accessing this SDK or the Snowbridge protocol, you and the Operator agree that no developer or entity involved in creating, deploying, maintaining, operating this SDK or the Snowbridge protocol, or causing or supporting any of the foregoing, will be liable in any manner for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of this SDK or the Snowbridge protocol, or this SDK or the Snowbridge protocol themselves, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value. By using or accessing this SDK, you represent that you are not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties or excluded or denied persons, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United States' Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union or its Member States, or any other government authority. You assume all risks associated with using the SDK, the Snowbridge protocol, and digital assets and decentralized systems generally, including but not limited to, that: (a) digital assets are highly volatile; (b) using digital assets is inherently risky due to both features of such assets and the potential unauthorized acts of third parties; (c) you may not have ready access to assets; and (d) you may lose some or all of your tokens or other assets. You agree that you will have no recourse against anyone else for any losses due to the use of the SDK or the Snowbridge protocol. For example, these losses may arise from or relate to: (i) incorrect information; (ii) software or network failures; (iii) corrupted cryptocurrency wallet files; (iv) unauthorized access; (v) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies; or (vi) third-party activities.`;
